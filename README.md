## What's the idea? 
Match with an awesome person who can walk your dog when you don't have time! Or find a dog to light up your day without taking on too many responsibilities!



## Inspiration

Dogs are adorable and amazing! A puppy could be the best gift in our life. However, on one hand, raising a dog means long-term responsibilities, we can’t make the promise easily; on the other hand, sometimes dog owners can't walk their dogs due to some reasons. Wouldn't it be better to find a reliable person to help rather than upset their puppies? 

As for people who always dream of owning a dog but haven't got a chance or are not ready to own one. This is a perfect chance to experience the life of having a dog! By helping dog owners to walk their dogs, dog lovers can not only have a fun time but also have a taste of what kind of dogs fit them best. 

## What it does

To solve this problem, we developed an android app. Registered dog owners and dog lovers can choose a time slot and then swipe the users based on their preference.  When a dog owner and a dog lover mutually like each other, they will match. Once they match, they can start a conversation and negotiate details about time and location to walk the dog.


## How we built it

Language: JAVA

Tools: Android-Studio, IntelliJ IDEA

Frameworks: Retrofit2, OKhttp, RxJava, Spring-Boot, Mybatis

Database: MySQL

Running environment: Google Cloud Platform

Version Control: Github

First, we discuss how this product looks like, including requirement analysis, and UI design. The requirement defines what we should implememnt and how components works. We uses yellow in the main theme which makes people feel energetic. 

According to software architecture, we seperate the front and rear ends which makes code orgnization clear and easy to read. The back-end runs with spring-boot and provides a serise of RESTful APIs. 

## Challenges we ran into

Inefficient team member communication. Each team member had different understandings of this project. Each part was built on individual perspective. We should've communicated with each other and exchanged ideas more frequently during the hackthon, so that we could have the same perspective and accomplished more functions in one day.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We can successfully run our code and operate our andriod app using a virtual device. We built a login/ register layout, time selection function and user communication layout. 
What's more we implemented the swiping card function.


## What we learned
1. Using Andriod Studio to build UI layout.
2. How to build an andriod app as a beginner.
3. How to deploy an andriod app on Google Cloud platform。
4. Better understanding of andriod development.

## What's next for Walk Your Dog
1. View users based on location.
2. Add a walking map function to our app to ensure the safety of the dog. The walking map will start to track the route and end tracking when a dog lover returns the dog safely.
3. User rating system
4. Dog recommendation system(machine learning)
